## Contributing to Apocrypha

Thanks for helping us document Skyrim's shame!

### How to add a new page

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/Sickliff/Apocrypha).
2. Create a new `.md` file inside the appropriate category in `docs/`. (Example: `docs/glitches/my-new-glitch.md`)
3. Write your article using Markdown.
4. Commit and push to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request back to the `main` branch.

Navigation is generated automatically based on folder structure, you don't need to edit `mkdocs.yml`.

### Article Format

Each page should include:

- A title (`# Dead Loading`)
- A short summary
- Steps or reproduction instructions
- Version information if relevant (LE/SE/AE or 1.6.629)
- Demonstration media (images, gifs, YouTube embeds using HTML)
- Miscellaneous notes

Remember to keep tone informational, avoid speculation without context, and never write from first person perspective.
