# Alchemy Loop
An **Alchemy Loop** is a way to greatly increase the strength of brewed potions. Each method involves abusing the Fortify Alchemy enchantment.

## Fortify Restoration Loop
The Fortify Restoration loop takes advantage of the fact that the Fortify Alchemy enchantment is governed by the restoration school. By drinking a Fortify Restoration potion, you can increase the strength of your Fortify Alchemy gear and create a stronger Fortify Restoration potion to repeat the process. You'll need some alchemy buffs in order for your potions to be strong enough to create a positive feedback loop, so it would be wise to [level](https://www.apocrypha.wiki/glitches/Leveling) your alchemy skill and take some relevant perks before/during the process.

You'll also need:
* Necklace, Helmet, and Bracers of Peerless Alchemy (Weaker/less enchantments may also work, but it's better to be on the safe side)
* Many Fortify Restoration alchemy ingredients
	* Yellow Mountain Flower or Hackle-Lo Leaf would be ideal due to their 1.25x strength

Once you have what you need, follow these steps:
1. Equip your Fortify Alchemy gear
2. Craft a Fortify Restoration potion and drink it
3. Re-equip your Fortify Alchemy gear and repeat from step 2

You should notice the strength increase each time you craft a potion. This will start slow but the numbers will raise progressively faster as you continue the loop. If your numbers plateau, consider raising your alchemy level or taking more alchemy perks.

## Alchemy + Enchanting Loop
This method is the simplest in concept. It consists of enchanting custom Fortify Alchemy gear, using it to create a Fortify Enchanting potion, and making stronger Fortify Alchemy gear with that potion to repeat the process. In practice this is the slowest alchemy loop, but it can still be used to create potions strong enough to [crash](https://www.apocrypha.wiki/glitches/Crashes) the game.

For the optimal conditions of this bug, you'll need to complete a rather lengthy setup. First, make sure your Alchemy and Enchanting skills are [maxed out](https://www.apocrypha.wiki/glitches/Leveling). You'll then want to collect and clear the Sallow Regent Black Book for access to the Seeker of Sorcery and Seeker of Shadows powers. You should also gain ownership of Severin Manor for easy access to enchanting and alchemy tables, and the ability to enter the Black Book. Additionally, exactly four pieces of Ahzidal's armor are required for the Ahzidal's Genius effect (Ahzidal's Genius will not be conferred if wearing more than 4 pieces).

You'll need an ample supply of:
* Grand Soul Gems
* Fortify Enchanting alchemy ingredients
	* Stoneflower Petals or Dreugh Wax would be ideal due to their 2x strength
* Unenchanted armor
	* Penitus Oculatus Helmets or Falmer Helmets (These headgear can be worn together with a circlet).
	* Circlets
	* Necklaces
	* Rings
	* Bracers

Once you have everything, use the following steps to perform the loop.
- Use The Sallow Regent to gain Seeker of Sorcery, and equip 4 pieces of Ahzidal's Armor
- Drink your Fortify Enchanting potion (If you're at the start of the loop you can use an Enchanter's Elixir, or ignore this part), then enchant a full set (Necklace, Ring, Bracers, and both Headgear) of Fortify Alchemy Gear
- Use The Sallow Regent to gain Seeker of Shadows, then equip your Fortify Alchemy Gear
- Brew a Fortify Enchanting potion and return to step 1

This may take some time, in part due to the loading screens needed to access the Black Book. Overall, the Fortify Restoration loop is more convenient.

## Notes
* You can optionally become a [Necromage Vampire](https://www.apocrypha.wiki/glitches/Necromage_Vampire) to perform alchemy loops quicker, as it will increase the strength of the fortify skill buffs applied to you.
